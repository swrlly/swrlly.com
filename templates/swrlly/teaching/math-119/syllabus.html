    <h2>Course Description</h2><hr>
    <p>
    A significant part of this course covers trigonometric functions and fundamental trigonometric identities. In particular, we will understand how trigonometric functions are developed from both a right angle and a unit circle perspective.</p>

    <p>After understanding what trigonometric functions are, we will derive various identities and use them to manipulate and simplify complicated trigonometric identities.</p>

    <p>The final part of this course will cover polar coordinates, parametric equations, and conic sections.</p>

    <h2>Course Methodology</h2><hr>
    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
    <p>The prerequisite for this course is Math 118. For our purpose, this means you need to understand and be able to use all concepts from Chapter 1 and Chapter 2.</p>
    <p>This prerequisite is <b>extremely critical</b> for your success in this class as the content in this class builds on Chapter 1 and 2. <b>If you have not mastered Chapter 1 and 2, you will struggle in this class.</b></p>
    <p>We will have a ungraded pretest on the first day of class. This will help you understand what concepts you should to review to succeed in this class.</p>
    
    <h4>Textbook</h4>
    <p>We will be using <i>Precalculus, Mathematics For Calculus, 7<sup>th</sup>edition</i> written by James Stewart et al.</p>
    <h4>Lectures</h4>
    <p>Lectures are held in class four days a week. Most lecture notes will be typed up, available on <a href="/teaching/math-118/lectures">at this page</a>.
    <p>Some examples will have a <span style="color:var(--examplecolor);">Show Solution</span> button. I recommend when you are reading through the notes to try solving the problem on paper, then comparing your solution after.</p>
    <h4>Think, Pair, Share</h4>
    <p>In lecture, after introducing a concept, seeing how to use it in a few examples, you will be given a similar problem to work on. We will use the following strategy:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Think</b>: Work independently on the problem for a few minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Pair</b>: Pair up with someone to discuss your thought process/solution to the problem.</li>
            <li><b>Share</b>: Volunteer to share your answer</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I will present my solution. Instead of passively absorbing math concepts we are learning by doing ðŸ˜¤</p>
    <h2>Grading</h2><hr>
    <h4>Homework</h4>
    <p>Homework will be posted every Thursday and due the following Thursday at the beginning of class. The accepted format is on paper in person. Grading is based on two criteria: completeless and a few problems will be chosen to be graded for correctness.</p>
    <h4>Quizzes</h4>
    <p>Quizzes will be in person every Thursday, except for the first week. They will be held during the last 10-15 minutes of class and will cover the previous week's material.</p>
    <h4>Exams</h4>
    <p>There will be two midterms and one final exam during finals week. All exams will be cumulative at the date the midterm is given.</p>
    <p>Exam dates:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Midterm 1</b>: Thursday, October 19</li>
        <li><b>Midterm 2</b>: Thursday, November 16</li>
        <li><b>Final</b>: Friday, December 15, 10:10 AM</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Grading Policy</h4>
    The aforementioned assignments have the following grading breakdown:
    <ul>
        <li>Homework: 10%</li>
        <li>Quizzes: 25%, lowest will be dropped</li>
        <li>Midterms: 20% each</li>
        <li>Final: 25%</li>
    </ul>
