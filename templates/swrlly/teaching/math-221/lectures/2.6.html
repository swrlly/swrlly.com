    <h1>2.6: The Derivative</h1>

    <h2>Maglev example (again)</h2>

    <div class="math-example">
        Suppose a maglev's position at time $t$ is determined by the function \[f(t) = 4t^2 \qquad 0 \leq t \leq 10\]
        <ol>
            <li>Find the average velocity over the time interval $[2, 4]$.</li>
            <li>Try to find the instantaneous velocity at $t = 2$ by doing the following:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Set up the average velocity formula for $[2, t]$ where $t > 2$.</li>
                    <li>Take the limit as $t \rightarrow 2$.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>The above limit has been shown to be two things at once: the instantaneous rate of change at $t = 2$ and the slope of the tangent line touching the curve at $(2, f(2)) = (2, 16)$.</p>

    <p>This phenomena is called the <b>derivative</b>.</p>

    <div class="math-def">
        The derivative of a function $f$ with respect to $x$ is the function $f'$ where \[f'(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\]
        The domain of $f'$ is the set of all $x$ for which the limit exists.
