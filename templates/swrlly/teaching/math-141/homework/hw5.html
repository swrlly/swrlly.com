        <li class="hw-space">What is the main intuition behind implicit differentiation?</li>

        <li class="hw-space">Isolate $z$ in the equation \[-\sin(xy)(x + xz) = 1 + \cos(y)z\]</li>

        <li class="hw-space">Given an equation in implicit form, should you manipulate the equation before applying the derivative to both sides?</li>

        <li class="hw-space">Here is the curve of $x^3 + y^3 = 6xy$ (called the Folium of Descartes): <img src="/static/swrlly/images/teaching/141-hw7-1.png" style="max-width:400px; margin:0 auto; display:flex; border-radius:10px; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em;"/>
        
        In implicit differentiation, we assume $y = f(x)$ under suitable conditions. Draw multiple graphs which represent these "suitable conditions." 
    
        Hint: Chop up the curve so each part passes the vertical line test.
        </li>

        <li class="hw-space">Find $dy/dx$ with implicit differentiation:
            <ol type="a">
                <li class="hw-space">$x^3 + x^2 + y^3 + y^2 = 1$</li>

                <li class="hw-space">$\sin(x + y) = y^2 \cos x$</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li class="hw-space">Find the equation of the tangent line at $(1,2)$ for the equation \[x^2  + 2xy - y^2 + x = 2\]</li>

        <li class="hw-space">Find the equation of the tangent line at $(\pi, \pi)$ for the equation \[\sin(x + y) = 2x - 2y\]</li>

        <li class="hw-space">When solving related rates problems, what is the second most common mistake people make?</li>

        <li class="hw-space">The area of a triangle with lengths $a$ and $b$ and included angle $\theta$ is \[A = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin \theta\] If $a = 2$ cm, $b = 3$ cm, and $\theta$ is increasing at a rate of $0.2$ rad/min, how fast is the area increasing when $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$?</li>

        <li class="hw-space">The formula for the volume $V$ of a cube with side length $s$ is $V = s^3$. The sides of the cube are 5 feet long and increasing at the rate of $0.2$ inches/second. How fast is the volume of the cube changing?</li>

        <li class="hw-space">The kinetic energy of an object is $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If the object is accelerating at a rate of $9.8 \ m/s^2$, and the mass is $30$ kilograms, how fast is the kinetic energy increasing when the speed is $30$ meters per second?

        <br/>Hint: Kinetic energy is measured in units $\frac{kg \cdot m^2}{s^2}$, so the rate of change of kinetic energy must be in units $\dfrac{\frac{kg \cdot m^2}{s^2}}{s} = \frac{kg \cdot m^2}{s^3}$

        <li class="hw-space">Suppose a drop of dye was dropped into a large bowl filled with water. If the dye spreads out in a circle and its radius is increasing at a rate of 2 cm/sec, determine how fast the area is increasing when the radius of the circle is 10 cm.</li>

        <li class="hw-space">If the minute hand of a clock has length r (in centimeters) find the rate at which it sweeps out area as a function of r.

            <br/>

        Use the equation of a sector of a circle $A = \dfrac{1}{2}r^2 \theta$ (picture showing this below) and the fact that the <b>rate</b> at which the minute hand moves is $2\pi$ radians per hour.

        <li class="hw-space">Suppose a meat distributor is willing to make $x$ pounds of beef available every week on the marketplace when the price is $\$p$ per pound. The relationship between quantity supplied $x$ and price $p$ is \[650p^2 - x^2 = 100\] If 30,000 pounds of beef are available on the marketplace this week and the price per pound is falling by 2 cents per week, at what rate is the supply falling? </li>

        <li class="hw-space">Two resistors are connected in parallel, shown as follows <img src="/static/swrlly/images/teaching/141-hw5-1.png" style="max-width:300px; margin:0 auto; display:flex; border-radius:10px; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em;"/>
        
            The total resistance $R$, measured in ohms $\left(\Omega\right)$ is calculated by \[\dfrac{1}{R} = \dfrac{1}{R_1} + \dfrac{1}{R_2}\] If $R_1$ is increasing $0.3\ \Omega$ per second and $R_2$ is increasing at $0.2\ \Omega$ per second, how fast is the total resistance $R$ changing when $R_1 = 80 \ \Omega$ and $R_2 = 100 \ \Omega$?

            Find the linearization of the following functions at the $x$-coordinate $a$.
            <ol type="a">
                <li class="hw-space">$f(x) = \sin x, \qquad a = 0$</li>

        <li class="hw-space">Now approximate $\sin(0.01)$ and $\cos(-0.01)$ without a calculator.</li>

        <li class="hw-space">Leibniz and prime notation for the derivative are equivalent: \[\dfrac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)\] Previously we said $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ must be treated as one entity. In Section 2.9 what new interpretation of $dy$ and $dx$ do we have that allows us to treat $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ like a fraction?</li>
