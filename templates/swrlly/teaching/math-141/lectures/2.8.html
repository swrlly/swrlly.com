    <h2>Related Rates</h2><hr>

    <p>Imagine a cop with a radar gun, waiting on the side of the street.</p>

    <p>You pass by in a car. The cop wants to know if you're speeding or not.</p>

    <p>Two quantities are changing with respect to time: the distance between you and the cop (call it $z$), and the distance between you and the point straight ahead of you perpendicular to the cop's line of vision to the road (call this distance $x$).</p>

    <p>It is easier to measure the rate of change of the distance $z$; the radar gun can measure this.</p>

    <p>However, the cop wants to know your real speed, or the rate of change or $x$.</p>

    <p><b>Related rates</b> problems are typically in the above setup. The rate of change of one quantity is easier to measure, and that rate will also tell us something about the harder to measure rate of change.</p>

    <p>In general, two quantities $x$ and $y$ will depend on a third quantity $t$. Given $dx/dt$, can we find $dy/dt$?</p>

        At a distance of 4000 feet from the launch site, a spectator is observing a rocket being launched. If the rocket lifts off vertically and is rising at a speed of 600 feet/second when it is at an altitude of 3000 feet, how fast is the distance between the rocket and the spectator changing at that instant?</div>
