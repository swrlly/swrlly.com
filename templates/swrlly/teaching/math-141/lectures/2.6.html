    <h2>2.6: Implicit Differentiation</h2><hr>

    <p>This section explores how to take the derivative of <b>implicit equations</b>.</p>

    <h2>Differentiating Implicitly</h2><hr>

    <p>Thus far, we have been given functions in the form $y = f(x)$, such as 
        \[
        y = x^2 \qquad
        y = \dfrac{t + 1}{t-1} \qquad
        y = \sqrt{36 - x}\]
    </p>

    <p>These functions are in <b>explicit form</b>, meaning the dependent variable is in the form $y = f(x)$, where $y$ is isolated and the other side is independent variables.</p>

    <p>Not all functions are of the form $y = f(x)$. Consider \[x^2y + y - x^2 + 1 = 0\] In thi form, $y$ is not explicitly a function of $x$, meaning $y$ is not isolated on one side. We call this an <b>implicit equation</b>.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it is possible to convert an implicit equation into an explicit equation. From above we see that
        \begin{align}
        x^2y + y - x^2 + 1 &= 0 \\
        y(x^2 + 1) &= x^2 - 1 \\
        y &= \dfrac{x^2 - 1}{x^2 + 1}
        \end{align}
    
    and we have converted the implicit equation into an <b>explicit equation</b>.</p>

    <p>This is not always possible. Consider \[y^4 - y^3 - y + 2x^3 - x = 8\]
        There is no way to isolate a single $y$ on one side.
    </p>

    <p>In this case, we want to assume we can take $y = f(x)$ under suitable conditions. These suitable conditions usually mean to force the implicit equation to pass the vertical line test by chopping it up into multiple functions:

    </p>

    <p>Finding the derivative of an implicit equation is called <b>implicit differentiation</b>.</p>

    <div class="math-example"> Given $y^2 = x$, find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$.</div>

    <p>In general:</p>

    <div class="math-fact"> <b style="color:var(--factcolor)">Finding $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ with Implicit Differentiation</b>
    <ol>
        <li class="lec-list-space">
            Apply $\dfrac{d}{dx}$ to both sides.
        </li>
        <li class="lec-list-space">
            Use the chain rule on terms involving $y$.
        </li>
        <li class="lec-list-space">
            Differentiate terms involving $x$ normally.
        </li>
        <li class="lec-list-space">
            Solve the equation for $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$.
        </li>
    </ol></div>

    <div class="math-example"> Given \[y^3 - y + 2x^3 - x = 8\] find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$.</div>

    <div class="math-example"> Given $x^2 + y^2 = 4$:
        <ol>
            <li class="lec-list-space">Find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ using implicit differentiation.</li>
            <li class="lec-list-space">Find the slope of the tangent line at $(1, \sqrt{3})$ in the above graph.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>Sometimes we need to use the product rule on terms involving both $x$ and $y$, such as $x^2y^3$.</p>

    <div class="math-example"> Find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ for the following equation \[x^2y^3 + 6x^2 = y + 12\]</div>

    <p>The next two problems involves product and chain rules.</p>

    <div class="math-example"> Find the tangent line to the equation \[x^3 + y^3 = 6xy\] at $(3,3)$.</div>

    <div class="math-example"> Find $dy/dx$ for the equation \[\sqrt{xy} = x + y\]

        <div class="math-solution">
            First, convert the square root into an exponent. Applying $\dfrac{d}{dx}$ gives 
            \begin{align}
            \dfrac{d}{dx}\left[(xy)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right] &= \dfrac{d}{dx}\left[x + y\right]
            \\\dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\cdot \dfrac{d}{dx}[xy] &= \dfrac{d}{dx}[x] + \dfrac{d}{dx}[y] 
            \\\dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(x\dfrac{d}{dx}[y] + y \dfrac{d}{dx}[x]) &= 1 + 1\cdot \dfrac{dy}{dx} 
            \\\dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(x\cdot 1\cdot \dfrac{dy}{dx} + y\cdot 1) &= 1 + \dfrac{dy}{dx}
            \\\dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}x\dfrac{dy}{dx} + \dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}y &= 1 + \dfrac{dy}{dx}
            \\\dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}x\dfrac{dy}{dx} - \dfrac{dy}{dx} &= 1 - \dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}y
            \\\dfrac{dy}{dx}\left(\dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}x - 1\right) &= 1 - \dfrac{1}{2}(xy)^{-\frac{1}{2}}y
            \\\dfrac{dy}{dx} &= \dfrac{1 - \dfrac{1}{2}\frac{1}{(xy)^{1/2}}y}{\dfrac{1}{2}\frac{1}{(xy)^{1/2}}x - 1}
            \\\dfrac{dy}{dx} &= \dfrac{1 - \dfrac{y}{2\sqrt{xy}}}{\dfrac{x}{2\sqrt{xy}} - 1}\cdot{\color{yellow} \dfrac{2\sqrt{xy}}{2\sqrt{xy}}}
            \\\dfrac{dy}{dx} &= \dfrac{2\sqrt{xy} - y}{x - 2\sqrt{xy}}
            \end{align}
        </div>

    <h2>Related Rates</h2><hr>

    <p>Imagine pumping air into a balloon.</p>

    <p>Two quantities are changing with respect to time.: the volume and the radius of the balloon.</p>

    <p>It is easier to measure the rate of change of volume due to being able to measure how much air you are pumping in.</p>

    <p>It is not as easy to measure the rate of change of the radius with respect to time.</p>

    <p><b>Related rates</b> problems are typically in the above setup. The rate of change of one quantity is easier to measure, and that rate will also tell us something about the harder to measure rate of change.</p>

    <p>In general, two quantities $x$ and $y$ will depend on a third quantity $t$. Given $dx/dt$, can we find $dy/dt$?</p>
