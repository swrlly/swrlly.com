    <h2>Course Description</h2><hr>
    <p>You will walk away from this class understanding
        <ul>
            <li>What functions are and how to manipulate and use them</li>
            <li>Common functions you will encounter in your journey through mathematics, such as polynomials, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions</li>
            <li>Graphs + transformations of functions and what they visually look like</li>
            <li>Solving linear/quadratic equations and inequalities</li>
            <li>how this class will help you be ready for calculus.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Course Methodology</h2><hr>
    <h4>Textbook</h4>
    <p>We will be using <i>Precalculus, Mathematics For Calculus, 7<sup>th</sup>edition</i> written by James Stewart et al. We will not be using WebAssign.</p>
    <h4>Lectures</h4>
    <p>Lectures are held in class four days a week. Most lecture notes will be typed up, available on <a href="/teaching/math-118/lectures">at this page</a>.
    <p>Some examples will have a <span style="color:var(--examplecolor);">Show Solution</span> button. I recommend when you are reading through the notes to try solving the problem on paper, then comparing your solution after.</p>
    <h4>Think, Pair, Share</h4>
    <p>In lecture, after introducing a concept, seeing how to use it in a few examples, you will be given a similar problem to work on. We will use the following strategy:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Think</b>: Work independently on the problem for a few minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Pair</b>: Pair up with someone to discuss your thought process/solution to the problem.</li>
            <li><b>Share</b>: Volunteer to share your answer</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I will present my solution. Instead of passively absorbing math concepts we are learning by doing ðŸ˜¤</p>
    
    <h2>Grading</h2><hr>
    <h4>Homework</h4>
    <p>Homework will be posted every Thursday and due the following Thursday at the beginning of class. The only accepted format is on paper in person and stapled in the top left corner.</p>
    <p>The only accepted format is on paper in person. Grading is based on two criteria: completeless and a few problems will be chosen to be graded for correctness.</p>
    <h4>Quizzes</h4>
    <p>Quizzes will be in person every Thursday, except for the first week. They will be held during the last 10-15 minutes of class and will cover the previous week's material.</p>
