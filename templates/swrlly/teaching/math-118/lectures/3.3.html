    <h1>3.3: Real Zeros of Polynomials</h1>

    <h2>What Are We Doing?</h2><hr>

    <p><a href="/teaching/math-118/lectures/3.1">Section 3.1</a> and <a href="/teaching/math-118/lectures/3.2">Section 3.2</a> focused on graphs of polynomials.</p>

    <p>We now dive into the algebra of polynomials; in particular we will look at how to factor polynomials into their real zeros.</p>

    <h2>Core Idea</h2><hr>

    <p>Recall the definition of a zero:</p>

    <div class="math-def"> <b>zeros</b><br>
        Suppose $P$ is a polynomial and $c$ is a real number. Then the following are equivalent:
        <ul>
            <li>$c$ is a zero of $P$.</li>
            <li>$c$ is a $x$-intercept of the graph of $P$.</li>
            <li>$x = c$ is a solution of the equation $P(x) = 0$. Meaning, $P(c) = 0$.</li>
            <li>$(x - c)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>#4 is the key here: if $c$ is a zero of a degree $n$ polynomial $P(x)$, then $P(x)$ admits a factorization \[\underbrace{P(x)}_{\deg n} = \underbrace{(x-c)}_{\deg 1}\cdot \underbrace{Q(x)}_{\deg n - 1}\]</p>

    <p>Dividing both sides by $(x-c)$: \[\dfrac{P(x)}{x - c} = Q(x)\]</p>

    <p>So in order to factor, we need to learn how to <b>divide polynomials</b>.</p>

    <h2>Long Division of Polynomials</h2><hr>

    <div class="math-def"> <b>division algorithm</b><br>
        $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ are polynomials, with $D(x) \neq 0$. Then there exist unique polynomials $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$, where the degree of $R(x)$ is 0 or less than the degree of $P(x)$ where:

        \[\dfrac{P(x)}{D(x)} = Q(x) + \dfrac{R(x)}{D(x)} \qquad \text{ or } \qquad P(x) = D(x)\cdot Q(x) + R(x)\]
        
        <ul>
            <li>$P(x)$ is the <b>dividend</b> (what you are dividing)</li>
            <li>$D(x)$ is the <b>divisor</b> (what you are dividing by)</li>
            <li>$Q(x)$ is the <b>quotient</b></li>
            <li>$R(x)$ is the <b>remainder</b>.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The second form is more useful, we will call it "one-line" notation.</p>

    <div class="math-example">
        Divide $6x^2 - 26x + 12$ by $x - 4$ and put the result in one-line notation.
    </div>

    <div class="math-example">
        Divide $8x^4 + 6x^2 - 3x + 1$ by $2x^2 - x + 2$ and put the result in one-line notation.
    </div>

    <h2>Remainder and Factor Theorems</h2><hr>

    <p>Now we will learn how to factor by dividing.</p>

    <div class="math-fact-notxt"> <b style="color:var(--factcolor);">Remainder Theorem</b><br>
        If $P(x)$ is divided by $x - c$, then the remainder is $P(c)$.
    </div>

    <div class="math-example">
        If $P(x) = 3x^5 + 5x^4 - 4x^3 + 7x + 3$ is divided by $(x + 1)$, what is the remainder?
    </div>

    <p>Remember that if $c$ is a zero of $P(x)$, then $P(c) = 0$.</p>
    <p>We just saw $P(c)$ is the remainder, and in particular, we just wrote down it has to be zero! Therefore:</p>

    <div class="math-fact-notxt"> <b style="color:var(--factcolor);">Factor Theorem</b><br>
        $c$ is a zero of $P$ if and only if $(x-c)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.
    </div>

    <div class="math-example">
        Suppose $P(x) = x^3 - 7x + 6$. Show that $P(1) = 0$, and use this fact to completely factor $P(x)$.
    </div>

    <p>In general, here's how to completely factor a polynomial if you only want real-valued coefficients.</p>

    <div class="math-method"> <b style="color:var(--factcolor);">Complete Factorization of $P(x)$ over $\mathbb{R}$</b><br>
        For each zero $c$:
        <ol>
            <li><b style="color: var(--factcolor); margin-right: 0.5em;">Setup:</b>Convert into a factor $(x - c)$.</li>
            <li><b style="color: var(--factcolor); margin-right: 0.5em;">Divide:</b> Use the division algorithm to divide $P(x) = (x - c)Q(x)$.</li>
            <li><b style="color: var(--factcolor); margin-right: 0.5em;">Multiplicity:</b> Check if $c$ is a zero of $Q(x)$. If so, repeat and keep dividing $Q(x)$ until $c$ is no longer a zero. Move on to the next zero.</li>
        </ol>

        Repeat until you have a quadratic. Then factor using <a href="/teaching/math-118/lectures/1.3#newx">the "new" X method.</a>
    </div>

    <div class="math-example">
        Suppose $P(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x - 4$. Show that $P(1) = 0$ and $P(-1) = 0$ and use this fact to find a complete factorization over $\mathbb{R}$.
    </div>

    <div class="math-example">
        Suppose $P(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 4$. Show that $P(2) = 0$, and use this fact to find a complete factorization over $\mathbb{R}$.
    </div>

    <p>This last example had a factor $(x^2 + 1)$, which does not have a factorization over $\mathbb{R}$.</p>

    <p><a href="/teaching/math-118/lectures/3.5">Section 3.5</a> will show you how to deal with these!</p>
