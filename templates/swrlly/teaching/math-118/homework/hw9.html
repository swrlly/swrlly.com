            </ol>

        <li class="hw-space">To obtain a larger financial gain, determine which interest rate is better after 50 years:

        <li class="hw-space">A drug was taken by an individual. The number of milligrams remaining in the person's bloodstream after $t$ hours is \[D(t) = 50e^{-t}\]
            <ol type="a">
                <li class="hw-space">
                    As $t \rightarrow \infty$, what does $D(t)$ approach? Do you think this behavior is appropriate to model our intuition from the real world?

                <li class="hw-space">How many milligrams of the drug remains in the bloodstream after 5 hours?</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li class="hw-space">Animal populations are not capable of unrestricted growth because of limited habitat and food supplies. Under such conditions the population follows a <b>logistic growth model</b>:
            
            \[P(t) = \dfrac{d}{1 + ke^{-ct}}\]
            
            where $c,d$ and $k$ are positive constants. For a certain fish population in a small pond, we estimate $d = 1200, k = 11, c = 0.2$ and let $t$ be measured in years. The fish were introduced into the pond at time $t = 0$.
            <ol type="a">

                <li class="hw-space">Evaluate $P(t)$ for large values of $t$. In fact, as $t\rightarrow \infty$, what does the population approach?</li>
                <li class="hw-space">From your answer in part $(c)$, what does the constant $d$ represent? </li>
                <li class="hw-space">Graph $P(t)$ in Desmos. Does this function make sense in terms of a limited habitat and food supplies?</li>
                <li class="hw-space">From part $(d)$, what does this show us about setting parameters in functions? If this was a real life scenario, could we use these same ideas to model real life phenomena?</li>
