    <h2>Course Description</h2><hr>

    <p>This course is all about analyzing mathematical functions with calculus. We will begin by looking at limits and continuity of functions.</p>

    <p>A significant part of this course covers differential calculus and applications of the derivative in biological sciences.</p>

    <h2>Course Methodology</h2><hr>
    <h4>Textbook</h4>
    <p>We will be using <i>Biocalculus: Calculus for the Life
        Sciences</i> by James Stewart.</p>
    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
    <p>The prerequisite for this course is Math 118.
    <p>This prerequisite is <b>extremely critical</b> for your success in this class as the content in this class builds on precalculus. <b>You will struggle in this class if you have not mastered precalculus.</b></p>
    <p>I recommend Chapter 1 of the book <i>Precalculus, Mathematics for Calculus</i> by James Stewart if you are looking for a solid reference for precalculus.</p>
    <h4>Lectures</h4>
    <p>Lectures are held in class. Most lecture notes will be typed up, available on <a href="/teaching/math-161/lectures">at this page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Some examples will have a <span style="color:var(--examplecolor);">Show Solution</span> button. I recommend when you are reading through the notes to try solving the problem on paper, then comparing your solution after.</p>
    <h4>Homework</h4>
    <p>Homework will be posted every Tuesday and is due next Tuesday at the beginning of class. The only accepted format is on paper in person. Grading is based on two criteria: completeless and a few problems will be chosen to be graded for correctness.</p>
    <h4>Quizzes</h4>
    <p>Quizzes will be in person every Tuesday except the first week. They will be held during the last 15 minutes of class and will cover the previous week's material and homework.</p>
    <h4>Exams</h4>
    <p>There will be two midterms and one final exam during finals week. All exams will be cumulative at the date the midterm is given.</p>
    <p>Exam dates:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Midterm 1</b>: April 25th
        </li>
        <li><b>Midterm 2</b>: May 23rd
        </li>
        <li><b>Final</b>: <a href="https://registrar.calpoly.edu/spring-final-exam-schedule">Final Exam Schedule</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Grading</h2><hr>
    <h4>Grading Policy</h4>
    The aforementioned assignments have the following grading breakdown:
    <ul>
        <li>Homework: 10%</li>
        <li>Quizzes: 25%, lowest will be dropped</li>
        <li>Midterms: 20% each</li>
        <li>Final: 25%</li>

        <h4>Missing quizzes/exams</h4>
        <p>If a student misses a quiz or exam, the score of that test will be zero unless the student contacts the instructor to make alternate arrangements <b>before the beginning of the test</b> or presents an acceptable official document (e.g., doctorâ€™s note) explaining the absense. The final must be written at the scheduled time to pass the course.</p>

        <p>Students registered with the DRC should contact me ASAP so we can set up the necessary arrangements!</p>
        <h2>Getting Help</h2><hr>
        <p>A four unit class requires four hours of lecture and at least four hours of work outside of lecture. How to spend this time wisely?</p>
        <h4>Free Drop-In Tutoring</h4>
        <p>The Math and Stats Help Hub has drop-in virtual and in-person tutoring from Monday through Thursday 4-7 PM.
